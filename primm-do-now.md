# PRIMM: Do Now in Pairs

- **PRIMM** is short for (P)redict, (R)un, (I)nvestigate, (M)odify, and (M)ake

A snippet of Python code for you:
```python
first_name = 'Mike'
print(f'Hello, {first_name}!')
```

## (P)redict
In 2 - 3 sentences, explain *exactly* what you think the code snippet will do or display when you execute (*run*) the code.   

> *Your answer...*

## (R)un
- Open a new `main.py` file in VS Code and enter the two lines of code shown above
- Run your script and see what happens

## (I)nvestigate

- Is the person's name displayed in uppercase or lowercase when you run the script?
- What Python method would you apply to the script to make Python display the person's name in the opposite case?

> *Your answer...*


## (M)odify

- Modify your Python script in VS Code by assigning your first name to the variable `first_name`
- Also change the greeting from 'Hello' to another greeting that makes sense

## (M)ake
- Modify your script once more by writing the code to create a simple conversation
- You are one of the people in the conversation
- Add another person (such as a friend or a relative) to the conversation
- Imagine you are trying to decide which movie to see this weekend or what restaurant to go to after your school's football game

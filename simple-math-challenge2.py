# Part 1 / Perimeter Calculation

# Write a script that:
# lets the user enter two integers (numbers without a decimal point)
# The first number represents the WIDTH of a rectangle (in feet)
# The second number represents the HEIGHT of the rectangle (in feet)
# Calculate and display the perimeter of the rectangle (in feet)




# Part 2 / Tip Calculator
# Write a script that:
# lets the user enter the price of lunch at a local restaurant
# calculates the tip for the server (at 15 percent)  (HINT: Convert 15% to its decimal equivalent)
# displays the tip and the total price of the lunch separately
# What built-in Python function lets you treat the user's input as a floating-point number? (A number containing a decimal point)
# Search the Internet for the name of this function if you're not sure
